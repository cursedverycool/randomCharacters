# randomCharacters

***OMG SUPER VERY IMPORTANT PLZ READ UWUWUWUWUWU TWT OWO**
int length = (NUMBER OF RANDOM CHARACTERS U WANT TO GET GENERATED);
for example, int length = 10;
could output: WR B8T2.W. 
(length = 10 so 10 characters are outputted)
(W = 2)
(R = 1)
(B = 1)
(8 = 1) 
(T = 1)
(2 = 1)
(. = 2)
(  = 1)

W + R + B + 8 + T + 2 + . +  = 10


(ik we cant name a var with a number name but its just to show u guys how its working)


charac = characters
**when compile**
when compile this code will spam random charac (only the charac that are in this list)

-------------------------------------
**LIST OF CHARAC IN THE RANDOM CREATION**
". .. ... .... ....."
" . . . . ....    ..  "
"1234567890"
"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM"
"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"
",.Ã©;:-_`<.^o"
"\n \n\n   "
-----------------------------------------
so ye if u want to add/delete some of these then u just have to remove/add some charac in the list

**may be important ig**
if u wonder why its spamming its cuz of the while true. if u want to remove it just remove charac ill show here in the norma code UwU 

**first step OwO**
remove whole line 19 (in randome.cpp)

**second and last step TwT**
remove the last charac of line 22

**third step and frl the last ;)))))))))**
enjoy omg!!!
